/// Represents an object that can be completed. For example, a name text field can be completed when a name is entered and the done
/// button is pressed. Interested parties can set a handling closure to be alerted when the completion occurs. Optionally, a closure can be
/// assigned that returns valid if the object had valid data. For example, a name text field might return true only if a full name, first and
/// last, is entered. If the getCompletionResult handler is not assigned, the object should assume the result is valid.
